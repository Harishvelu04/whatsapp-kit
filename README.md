Step 1: Download the .py file.
Step 2: Extract the .py file.
Step 3: Open it in IDLE and view the code.
Step 4: Run the file as usual (press F5).
Step 5: The chatbot will be displayed on the screen.

Now you will see 4 input fields and 4 buttons – this is the layout of the application.

     Input 1: Enter the candidate’s mobile number with the country code.

     Input 2: Enter the message you want to send.

     Input 3 & 4: If you want to send the message at a specific time, enter the hour and minute here (in 24-hour format).

Button Functions:

     Button 1: Prepares the message to send. You still need to click the Send button in your logged-in WhatsApp window. (It won’t send automatically, just gets it ready.)

     Button 2: Sends the message at the scheduled time (based on the hours and minutes you set).

     Button 3: Sends the message immediately.

     Button 4: Sends the message every 10 seconds (up to 3 times).

Note: You must already be logged in to WhatsApp on your default browser.
